## Why Base
If you are an avid gamer, you know the struggle of finding like minded people to play with. Every gaming community has toxic players that come with it, and we know how much those people can ruin your gaming experience. Not many games have a good Looking for Group tool, and that is why we created Base. Base will allow gamers to hand pick who they play games with by giving them the ability to create and join lobbies for all of the top games. Base was created to take the randomness out of matchmaking that all games have. The goal of our app is help gamers find not just gamers they like, but people they enjoy playing with.

## What is Base
Base is a global Looking for Group Tool. What does this mean exactly? The only game that has a fleshed out LFG tool is World of Warcraft. Every other game doesn't really give you a way to find other gamers to game with inside the game. When you visit Base, you can do 1 of 2 things, create a lobby, or find a lobby. If you create a lobby, you will need to provide all the information neccesarry, stuff like what game, region, platform, and start time etc. If you search for a lobby, you will make 3 selections, platorm, region, and game, and you will see all of the lobbies that match that criteria. When you create or join a lobby you will join a chatroom unique to that lobby. It is here the sign-uppers and lobby leader will communicate and figure out if they want to game together. You can share anything you'd like here. Your rank, your main character, what you expect from the group. It is all player controlled, and the lobby leader will be able to accept or decline annyone who signs up. Once the lobby leader is ready to go, its ready to hop in game. You can share you gaming tags through the chat system, as well as a discord link. It's all player controlled.
